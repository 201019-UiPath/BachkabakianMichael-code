C#
Namespace
    Types
        Members (Methods, variables, properties)

Types (Classes, Enums, Structs, Interface, Delegates)
    -All types in C# are inherited directly or indirectl from a class thats callde System.Object
    -Value Types: which has the direct value, Stacstored i memort stack, fast to acess.
        Strucs, Enums. Predefined examples (int, long, short, byte, DateTime, Char)
    -Reference Types: it stores the refernce to that value, value is stored in heap, expensive retrieval process
        Classes, interfaces, Delegates. Predefined examples (String, arrays, collections etc)

Access Modifiers: they change the behavior and scope of the types.
Scopes : Private, Public, Internal, 

Properties: like getters and setters in java. methods that are used for data verification

Collections: In memory Storage of data
    -Arrays: 1D, 2D, jagged arrays and multi-dimensional arrays.
        -drawbacks -> size is fixed
        -memory inefficient
    -Generics: Stack<T>, Queues<T>, Lists<T>, Dictionary
        -Type safe classes
        -they are memory efficient by being dynamic in size
